To tell a story that spans multiple sections, for example, changing the background based on the section in view,
multiple sections tracking tools of `react-scrollytelling` can help you achieve this.

Instead of tracking every section individually and listening to window scroll events in each section, `react-scrollytelling`
only tracks the sections that are viewport to minimize the performance impact.


## Building a scrollytelling story with multiple sections

Here are some key concepts to keep in mind when building a scrollytelling story with multiple sections:

### Active section

When there are multiple sections in the viewport, the effects to show should be based on the section that the user is currently viewing.

We call the section the user is currently viewing the "active section", and it the section that has just been scrolled into view.
Therefore, the active section is the section that is closest to the bottom of the viewport.

### Scroll progress

For the reading/scroll progress of the active section, it is defined as `the height above the bottom of the viewport` divided by `the height of the active section`.
