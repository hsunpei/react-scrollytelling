import { Reveal } from '../../components/reveal/Reveal';


Creating a reveal effect on a webpage can significantly enhance user engagement and provide a dynamic browsing experience.
The `useIntersectionReveal()` hook can be employed to detect when an element enters the viewport and trigger animations or transitions.

It can be integrated with CSS animations or JavaScript libraries such as `react-spring` or `framer-motion` to animate text, images,
or other elements as they come into view,
making the content more interactive and visually appealing.


## Usage

`useIntersectionReveal(sectionRef, trackOnce, options)` gives you the ability to track whether the element (tracked with `sectionRef`)
enters the viewport. It takes two arguments:
- `sectionRef`: A reference to the element to observe.
- `trackOnce`: A boolean that determines whether to observe the element only once. Default value: `false`.
- `options`: Allow customizing the observer. You can pass an `IntersectionObserverOptions` [object to configure the observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver#instance_properties).


```tsx
  import { useIntersectionReveal } from '@react-scrollytelling/core';

  // inside a React component
  const trackOnce = true;
  const sectionRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const { isIntersecting } = useIntersectionReveal(sectionRef, trackOnce);

  return (
    <div
      ref={sectionRef}
      style={{
        opacity: isIntersecting ? 1 : 0,
        transform: isIntersecting ? 'translateY(0)' : 'translateY(10px)',
      }}
    >
      Play animation when it enters the viewport
    </div>
  );
```

## Example



### Reveal multiple times

`trackOnce` is false by default, which means that we want to trigger the animation every time the element enters the viewport:

<Reveal />


### Reveal once

`trackOnce` is true, which means that we want to trigger the animation only once when the element enters the viewport.
This is a very common use case for product page animations/lazy loading images:

<Reveal trackOnce={true} />


## Behind the scenes

`useIntersectionReveal()` hook is a simple wrapper around the `useIntersectionObserver()` hook,
which uses the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) to detect when an element enters the viewport, and changes the `isIntersecting` state accordingly,
and disconnect the observer when `trackOnce` is true and the element is already in view.
